# EncryptorDecryptor

- Just a project to have fun learning on simple encrypting and decrypting messages.
- The res file contains the `Key` for the encryption and decryption.
- For now, to make it easier, every character has a unique ecrypted opposing character.
- This will make the parsing and identification easier
