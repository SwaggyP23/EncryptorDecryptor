# EncryptorDecryptor

- Just a project to have fun learning on simple encrypting and decrypting messages.
- The res file contains the `Key` for the encryption and decryption.
- For now, to make it easier, every character has a unique ecrypted opposing character.
- This will make the parsing and identification easier
- You should compile with `-std=c++20` or higher flag to be able to access the **structured bindings** used in `Decryptor.cpp`
